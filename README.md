# Password-Generator

## Objective

This is a Password Generator that generates a password based on user input. The user will choose at least one of four character types for their personalized password. The Generator will then take the input and make a random password. The user can continue to generate different passwords until they find one they would like to use. After, the user can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button and their randomized personal password will be copied to their system's clipboard. Then, they can paste it where ever they need it. 

## Purpose

In today's world, password security is very important. With this Password Generator the user is sure to find their accounts secure from those pesky password guessers. The days of making all your passwords a combination of your pet's name and your birthday are behind you. 

## Process

The first thing I did to tackle this challege was to plan each step in pseudo code. 

Then, I started inserting the code I knew I needed and testing each peice with a console.log

After, I worked on the syleing of the page.

Finally, I worked on piecing everything together until it worked how I wanted it to.
